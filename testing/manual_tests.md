# Manual Testing for HODEditorJS inputs and outputs

## Objective

The objective of this document is to log happy path testing to make sure everything works as it should, any agent reading this document will be able to look at the testing history at each snapshot (by timestamp generated after changes were done). So when a change is applied, a new test section must be added following the current template.

Agent would create this file in the testing subdirectory for a HOD, adding test snapshots from the template for the user to fill in after manual testing (snapshot date should be added by the agent for when it changed something and asks the user to test). On every change there must be a commit to track the snapshots.

## Resources

All test resources (original files being edited and output files resulting from editing) are located here:

`/run/media/system/Data/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Homeworld 347380/GBXTools/WorkshopTool/mod-tools/HODEditorJS/testing/`

The files to look for contain the following naming conventions:

`*_2.0_original.hod` -> HOD 2.0 file that currently works 100% in game
`*_1.0_original.hod` -> For original HOD 1.0 file of the same ship (may contain differences from 2.0 original file)
`*_from_2.0_to_2.0.hod` -> original HOD 2.0 File opened in editor and saved directly to test similarity and compatibility to game engine
`*_from_1.0_to_2.0.hod` -> original HOD 1.0 file opened in editor and saved directly as HOD 2.0 to test compatibility with game engine (might be different to original HOD 2.0 file in terms of collision mesh and nodes, importance is compatibility in main meshes and textures with game)
