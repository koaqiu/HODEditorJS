# Manual Testing for HODEditorJS inputs and outputs

## Objective

The objective of this document is to log happy path testing to make sure everything works as it should, any agent reading this document will be able to look at the testing history at each snapshot (by timestamp generated after changes were done). So when a change is applied, a new test section must be added following the current template.

Agent would create this file in the testing subdirectory for a HOD, adding test snapshots from the template for the user to fill in after manual testing (snapshot date should be added by the agent for when it changed something and asks the user to test). On every change there must be a commit to track the snapshots.

## Resources

All test resources (original files being edited and output files resulting from editing) are located here:

`/run/media/system/Data/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Homeworld 347380/GBXTools/WorkshopTool/mod-tools/HODEditorJS/testing/`

The files to look for contain the following naming conventions:

`*_2.0_original.hod` -> HOD 2.0 file that currently works 100% in game
`*_1.0_original.hod` -> For original HOD 1.0 file of the same ship (may contain differences from 2.0 original file)
`*_from_2.0_to_2.0.hod` -> original HOD 2.0 File opened in editor and saved directly to test similarity and compatibility to game engine
`*_from_1.0_to_2.0.hod` -> original HOD 1.0 file opened in editor and saved directly as HOD 2.0 to test compatibility with game engine (might be different to original HOD 2.0 file in terms of collision mesh and nodes, importance is compatibility in main meshes and textures with game)

Additional findings on HOD 1.0 loading regarding textures:
For HOD 1.0 files loaded onto editor from `/run/media/system/Data/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Homeworld 347380/GBXTools/WorkshopTool/uncompressed_bigs/freespace_remastered/ship/`
Something we need to take a look at, strictly for fixing loading of textures in HOD 1.0 files

- ter_centaur: DXT1 textures loaded correctly, DXT5 texture is broken
- ter_zephyrus: all textures loading correctly and not flipped (all DXT1)
- ter_fenris: textures loading at full, but y flipped (all DXT1)
- ter_leviathan: texture leviathan DIFF (DXT5) corrupted on load.
- ter_demon: Texture Capital04-01 loaded corrupted (DXT5), all textures y flipped
- shi_azrael: all textures loaded correctly (DXT1)
- shi_scorpion: all textures loaded correctly (DXT1)
- if material has DIFF selected as (none), the texture defaults to another DIFF instead of no texture. (this is a regression of existing functionality)

Pattern here is weird, all DXT5 textures load corrupted and flipped, but not all DXT1 textures looks correct in orientation

Test hod: `ter_fenris`, `ter_centaur`, `ter_leviathan`

**Goal**: Verify HOD 1.0 inline LMIP/TEXM multi-mip texture offset fix and `(None)` material texture slot regression fix.

Automated checks:

1. Parser/build verification:
    - `cargo check --lib`: [x] PASS - 38 pre-existing warnings only.
    - `cargo run --bin verify_lossless`: [x] PASS - structural re-parse counts match; expected size differences remain from recompression.
    - `npm run build`: [x] PASS - existing Vite large chunk warning only.
2. Targeted HOD 1.0 texture probes before cleanup:
    - `ter_centaur transparentDXT5`: [x] PASS - legacy DXT5 data starts immediately after base dimensions; parsed PNG length changed 370 -> 210 after offset fix.
    - `ter_fenris nameplateDXT5`: [x] PASS - multi-mip DXT5 no longer skips 72 bytes into compressed data; parsed PNG length changed 127938 -> 1214.
    - `ter_leviathan leviathanDXT5`: [x] PASS - multi-mip DXT5 decodes from corrected base offset.
    - Material DIFF `(none)` slot: [x] PASS - Viewport and Inspector no longer fuzzy-match empty texture names to the first texture.

Test hod: `ter_centaur`, `ter_fenris`, DAE import

**Goal**: Verify singleton COL node behavior: only one COL may exist, it must display/save as `Root`, users cannot rename it, and deleting it persists through save/reopen.

Automated checks:

1. Parser/build verification:
    - `cargo check --lib`: [x] PASS - 37 pre-existing warnings only.
    - `cargo run --bin verify_lossless`: [x] PASS - structural re-parse counts match; expected size differences remain from recompression.
    - `npm run build`: [x] PASS - existing Vite large chunk warning only.

Manual COL Retest:

1. Open HOD 2.0 `ter_centaur_2.0_original.hod` in editor:
    - Exactly one COL node appears: [ ] PENDING
    - COL node displays as `Root`: [ ] PENDING
    - Rename is not available for COL: [ ] PENDING
    - Delete removes the COL node: [ ] PENDING
    - Save/reopen after delete does not synthesize a new COL: [ ] PENDING
2. Open HOD 1.0 `ter_fenris_1.0_original.hod` in editor:
    - If a collision is parsed, exactly one COL node appears: [ ] PENDING
    - Parsed COL node displays as `Root`: [ ] PENDING
    - Save/reopen preserves singleton behavior: [ ] PENDING
3. Import a DAE with multiple `COL[...]` geometries:
    - Only one COL node is imported: [ ] PENDING
    - Imported COL node displays as `Root`: [ ] PENDING
4. Add Node modal:
    - Collision creation uses fixed `Root` name with no editable name field: [ ] PENDING
    - Adding a second collision is blocked until the existing COL is deleted: [ ] PENDING
