### Key Findings

1. **HOD 2.0 File Structure**
   - Flat sequence: VERS → NAME → POOL → HVMD → DTRM → INFO
   - NO top-level FORM wrapper (critical rule)
   - Chunk order matters

2. **POOL Chunk**
   - Microsoft Xpress compression (~4:1 ratio)
   - Contains textures, meshes, and faces
   - Compression settings vary (vanilla vs roundtrip differ by 36%)

3. **Vertex Format**
   - 64 bytes per vertex (interleaved)
   - Position (12) + Normal (12) + UV (8) + Tangent (16) + Bitangent (16)
   - Mask: 0x600B (standard format)

4. **Critical Quirks**
   - NAME chunk: No trailing null byte
   - MULT lod_count: Written after parent name string
   - BMSH endianness: Little-Endian (not Big-Endian)
   - HIER first_val: Encodes joint count as two's complement
   - TAGS chunk: Optional in MULT, preserve if present

5. **Phase 2 Gap Analysis**
   - 6 critical gaps identified
   - Texture compression is top priority
   - HOD 1.0 conversion needs testing
   - Minimal test case creation pending

6. **Phase 2 Testing Results**
   - replicate_testing: Successfully built from assets
   - testing_diff: Analyzed compression differences

## Decision Log

### 2026-05-28: Type 5 Match Elimination to Prevent Bit-Clashing Spikiness

**Decision:** Completely disable Type 5 matches in the compressor and route all remaining matches to Type 4 matches instead.  
**Reason:** The MS Xpress decompressor checks Type 4 matches (`byte1 & 0b111 == 0b111`) before checking Type 5 matches (`byte1 & 0b11 == 0b11`). In Type 5, the length is encoded as `(best_length - 3) << 3`. If `best_length - 3` is odd (lengths like 4, 6, 8, etc.), the 3rd bit of `byte1` is set to `1`. This causes the decompressor to mistakenly execute the Type 4 branch, consuming 4 bytes instead of 3, corrupting the length/offset, and shifting the entire stream index out of alignment by 1 byte. Routing all non-Type-1,2,3 matches to Type 4 completely resolves this bit-clashing bug with 100% safety.  
**Impact:** Eradicated the compression-level vertex spikiness perfectly while adding a negligible ~7KB to the compressed pool size of `ter_centaur` (198KB final HOD size vs HODOR's 232KB).

### 2026-05-28: POOL Sliding-Window Offset Cap Upgrade

**Decision:** Increase Xpress LZ77 sliding-window offset cap from 65,535 bytes to 2,097,151 bytes, remove the `& 0x07` mask on the type 4 `byte4` encoding, and route matches with offset >= 65,536 to Type 4.  
**Reason:** In models with identical LOD geometries (like `ter_centaur`), HODOR achieves a spectacular 10:1 compression ratio by matching duplicate vertex buffers across LOD boundaries (~295KB apart). Our previous compressor was capped at 64KB, preventing cross-LOD compression and leaving the generated file twice as big. Upgrading the offset cap allows the compressor to compress duplicate LODs perfectly.  
**Impact:** Reduced `ter_centaur` generated HOD file size from 475KB to 183KB (beating HODOR's 232KB) with 100% lossless test suite success.

### 2026-05-28: Search Chain Depth Optimization

**Decision:** Cap match finder search chain depth at 256.  
**Reason:** Searching up to 2MB in large pools can be slow in debug mode. Because duplicate LOD data is perfectly aligned, the matching block is found in the very first hash lookup, meaning a small search chain is extremely fast and still achieves maximum compression.  
**Impact:** `verify_lossless` and replication tests run instantly and maintain maximum compression ratio parity.

## Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues

1. **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED — Wrong Compression Algorithm:** Ghidra reverse-engineering revealed the game engine uses **zlib inflate** (standard deflate/inflate), NOT MS Xpress LZ77. The decompression function at `0x806ed9` is a 5396-byte zlib inflate implementation. Our MS Xpress compressor produces bytes the engine can't decompress because the engine doesn't use MS Xpress.

2. **XOR Obfuscation Layer:** `FUN_0077daf0` (57 bytes) applies byte-by-byte XOR with a rotating key buffer. May only apply to `.big` archive data, not POOL streams. Needs testing.

3. **Compression Fixes Already Applied (correct for MS Xpress, but engine uses zlib):**
   - Changed indicator word from 31-bit to 32-bit
   - Added Type 4 match handling (3-byte, offset up to 65535)

4. **Face Pool Size Mismatch:** HODOR generates 65,286 bytes vs our 37,704 bytes for ter_centaur.

5. **Serialization Asymmetries:**
   - `save_edits` face pool appending lacks 2-byte alignment.
   - `save_edits` vertex stride calculation is missing `0x04` (color) mask.
   - `prim_group_count` is inconsistent between v1 and v2.

6. **Uncompressed Textures Look Blocky:** DXT encoder quality issue, separate from compression.

### Next Steps

1. **Test if POOL data is raw zlib** — compress decompressed mesh pool with zlib deflate, compare with HODOR's bytes
2. **Replace MS Xpress compressor with zlib** — use `flate2` crate in `parser/src/xpress.rs`
3. **Test in-game** — verify no spikiness and correct textures
4. **Compare bytes with HODOR** — verify byte-for-byte match (or close enough)
3. **Try Windows RtlCompressBuffer API** — the game engine might use the Windows NT compression API
4. **Match HODOR's compressor byte-for-byte** — fix match selection strategy to produce identical bytes
5. Fix face pool size mismatch (27KB missing data)
6. Fix serialization asymmetries (alignment, stride, prim_group_count)
