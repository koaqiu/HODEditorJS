# Homeworld Remastered HOD Editor (`HODEditorJS`)

A modern, cross-platform visual editor for Homeworld Remastered (HWRM) `.hod` ship skeleton and mesh files. Built with **Tauri**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Three.js**, and a custom standalone **Rust parser (`hwr_hod_parser`)**.

This tool lets you inspect, edit, and save `.hod` files with a visual interface. It supports migrating legacy **HOD 1.3** files to **HOD 2.0**, building weapon assemblies, editing collision hulls, managing materials and textures, and creating animations.

## Known Limitations

This editor is actively developed and has known gaps. Please be aware before using it in production modding workflows:

**Editing Limitations**
- **No Undo/Redo**: There is no undo or redo system. Any change is permanent once made. Save frequently and keep backups.
- **No Multi-Select**: Only one node can be selected at a time.
- **No Copy/Paste/Duplicate**: There is no clipboard or duplication functionality. Nodes must be created manually.
- **No Keyboard Shortcuts**: All operations must be performed through the UI. No hotkey bindings exist.
- **No Batch Operations**: No batch rename, batch reparent, or batch property editing.
- **No Scale Gizmo**: Only Move and Rotate transform gizmos are available in the viewport. Scale transform is not exposed.
- **No LOD generation**: WIP to auto generate LOD meshes based on LOD0 mesh.

**File Format Issues**
- **Saving as HOD 1.3**: The editor saves files using the HOD 2.0 binary format.
- **Opening HOD 1.0 (HW2 Classic)**: Untested, can currently only open 1.3 and 2.0 HODs
- **DAE Import is Unstable**: The Collada/DAE importer is a work in progress. It may cause crashes on HODs created with this, produce incorrect hierarchy structures, or fail on complex models. Use OBJ import for reliable mesh replacement. Back up your work before attempting DAE import.

**Textures**
- **No Texture Filtering**: The exported HOd does not apply mipmapping or texture filtering. Textures may appear aliased at close.
- **Missing Texture Filtering**: Texture previews in the material inspector are raw PNG conversions without filtering.

**General**
- **No Preferences Persistence**: Window size, panel widths, and last-opened paths are not persisted between sessions.

## OBJ Import Guide

The editor supports importing Wavefront `.obj` files to replace mesh geometry at any LOD level, as well as collision hulls, engine glow meshes, and engine shape meshes.

### Axis Orientation

Homeworld Remastered uses a specific coordinate system. When exporting OBJ files from Blender, Maya, or other 3D tools, ensure your model is oriented as follows once imported in the editor:

| Axis | Direction | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Z** | Front | The forward direction of the ship (bow/nose) |
| **Y** | Vertical | The up direction (top of the ship) |
| **X** | Horizontal | The lateral direction (port/starboard) |

```
        Y (Up)
        |
        |
        +---- Z (Front)
       /
      /
     X (Horizontal)
```

The information below might need verification:

**Blender Export Settings:**
- Forward axis: **-Z** (or adjust to match Z-Front convention)
- Up axis: **Y Up**
- Apply transforms before export (Ctrl+A > All Transforms)
- Ensure your ship model faces the Z-positive direction and is upright on Y

**Maya Export Settings:**
- Up axis: **Y**
- Forward axis: **Z**

### Importing Mesh LODs

1. Select a **Mesh** node in the hierarchy tree
2. In the Inspector panel, find the LOD variant list
3. Select the LOD level you want to replace
4. Click **Import OBJ** to load your `.obj` file
5. The mesh geometry replaces the selected LOD in-place, reconstructing positions, normals, and UV coordinates

### Importing Collision Hulls and Auto Generation

1. Select a **Collision** node in the hierarchy tree
2. In the Inspector panel, click **Import OBJ** under the collision mesh section
3. The OBJ geometry is imported into the collision hull mesh parts
4. You can also use **Generate Convex Hull** to auto-generate a collision mesh from the visual mesh, or **Calculate Box Bounds** for a simple bounding box

### Importing Engine Glow/Shape

1. Select an **Engine Glow** or **Engine Shape** node
2. In the Inspector panel, click **Import OBJ**
3. The mesh replaces the engine glow/shape geometry

### Exporting

All importable mesh types can also be exported as `.obj` files via the corresponding **Export OBJ** buttons. Exported files include `.mtl` material references and TGA textures are written to the same folder.

---

## DAE Import (WIP)

> **Warning**: The DAE/Collada importer is experimental and unstable. It may crash the editor, produce incorrect results, or generate HOD files that cause in-game crashes. Use OBJ import for reliable workflows. Back up your work before using this feature.

The editor can import Collada `.dae` files through the toolbar **Import DAE** button. The Rust backend parses the XML structure and attempts to:

- Auto-repair assembly naming conventions
- Clean hierarchy structures
- Deduplicate node names
- Normalize collision meshes

This feature is under active development. Complex DAE files with advanced features (skin weights, morph targets, multiple scenes) are not supported.

## Installation & Running

### Compiled Binaries

You can find pre-compiled release binaries for Linux (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`) and Windows (`.exe` installer) in the releases tab, or build them yourself using the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.x or newer
- [Rust & Cargo](https://rustup.rs/) v1.75.0 or newer
- Platform-specific Tauri dependencies ([Tauri Prerequisites Guide](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/))

### Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd HODEditorJS
npm install
```

### Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build Linux Binaries (.deb, .rpm, .AppImage)

**All builds must be performed inside the `esp-dev` distrobox.** Native host builds fail due to missing GTK/WebKit dependencies and AppImage FUSE issues.

```bash
# Enter the distrobox
distrobox enter esp-dev

# Build Linux bundles (NO_STRIP=1 required on Fedora 41+ to bypass outdated linuxdeploy strip)
NO_STRIP=1 npm run tauri build
```

**Output:**
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/HODEditorJS_1.1.0_amd64.deb`
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/rpm/HODEditorJS-1.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm`
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/HODEditorJS_1.1.0_amd64.AppImage`

### Cross-Compile Windows Installer (.exe) from Linux

Windows cross-compilation uses `mingw-w64` inside the same `esp-dev` distrobox. The `dlltool` path-with-spaces bug requires `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cargo_target`.

```bash
distrobox enter esp-dev

# Add the Rust target (only needed once)
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# Build Windows NSIS installer
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cargo_target npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --bundles nsis
```

**Output:**
- `/tmp/cargo_target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/hodeditorjs.exe` (23 MB)
- `/tmp/cargo_target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/bundle/nsis/HODEditorJS_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (11 MB)

### Windows Runtime DLLs

The Windows installer bundles MinGW runtime DLLs because `meshopt 0.6.2` explicitly links `libstdc++` dynamically via `cc-rs`. This means `-static-libstdc++` alone does not remove the import — the DLLs must be installed alongside the exe.

The NSIS hook at `src-tauri/windows/nsis-hooks.nsh` installs these into `$INSTDIR` during installation:

- `libstdc++-6.dll`
- `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`
- `libwinpthread-1.dll`

These are wired into Tauri via `bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Do not remove this config unless the `meshopt` crate is patched to use static C++ linkage.

---

## Development & Testing

```bash
# Check parser compilation
cargo check --manifest-path parser/Cargo.toml

# Run parser unit tests and LZ77 roundtrip verifications
cargo test --manifest-path parser/Cargo.toml
```
